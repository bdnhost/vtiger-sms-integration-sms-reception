SMS Integration for Vtiger CRM
In this guide, I will walk you through the process of setting up an integration to receive SMS messages directly into the "HelpDesk" (Trouble Tickets) module in Vtiger CRM. This integration will create a new trouble ticket for each incoming SMS, and will also map the sender's phone number to the appropriate contact in the CRM if it exists.

1. Creating Custom Fields in the HelpDesk Module
To properly record the incoming SMS data, you need to create the following custom fields in the HelpDesk module:

Go to the Vtiger CRM settings:
Log in to your Vtiger CRM.
Click on the gear icon (settings) in the upper right corner.
Access the Field Layout Editor:
Navigate to "Module Management" > "Module Layouts & Fields."
Choose "HelpDesk" (Trouble Tickets) from the list of modules.
Add the custom fields:
Create the following fields:
Field Label	Field Name	Data Type	Mandatory	Hidden
Sender	cf_sender	Text	No	No
Receiver	cf_receiver	Text	No	No
Received At	cf_received_at	DateTime	No	No
Message	cf_message	Text Area	No	No
Save the changes:
Once the fields are created, save the layout.
2. Creating a WebForm for SMS Integration
To capture the incoming SMS data, you need a WebForm in Vtiger CRM. Follow these steps:

Create the WebForm:
Go to "Marketing" > "WebForms."
Click "New Webform" and fill in the details:
Form Name: "SMS to Ticket"
Description: "Form to capture incoming SMS as tickets"
Target Module: "HelpDesk"
Add Fields to the WebForm:
In the WebForm editor, add the following fields:
Subject: "Ticket Title"
Priority: "Normal" (Select value)
Status: "SMS" (Select value)
Sender: "cf_sender"
Receiver: "cf_receiver"
Received At: "cf_received_at"
Message: "cf_message"
Contact Name: "contact_id"
Make sure to set the "Field Type" appropriately for each field.
Generate the WebForm:
Save and publish the WebForm.
Note the publicid and the __vtrftk token, which will be used in the sms-receiver.php script.
3. Configuring the SMS Receiver Script
Hereâ€™s an example sms-receiver.php file that integrates with the WebForm created in step 2:

php
Copy code
<?php
// Database connection details
$db_server = 'localhost';
$db_port = ':3306';
$db_username = 'your_db_username';
$db_password = 'your_db_password';
$db_name = 'your_db_name';

$vtiger_form_url = "https://your-vtiger-domain.com/modules/Webforms/capture.php"; // Webform URL

$conn = new mysqli($db_server . $db_port, $db_username, $db_password, $db_name);

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
echo "Connected successfully\n";

// Function to extract the last eight digits of a phone number
function last_8_digits($phone) {
    return substr($phone, -8);
}

// Receive and insert SMS data into a ticket
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {
    $sender = $_POST['sender'];
    $receiver = $_POST['receiver'];
    $message = $_POST['msg'];
    $received_at = date('Y-m-d H:i:s');

    // Normalize sender phone number
    $last8Sender = last_8_digits($sender);
    echo "Last 8 digits of sender: $last8Sender\n";

    // Check for matching contact in VTiger
    $contactSql = "SELECT contactid, firstname, lastname FROM vtiger_contactdetails WHERE SUBSTRING(REPLACE(phone, '-', ''), -8) = '$last8Sender' OR SUBSTRING(REPLACE(mobile, '-', ''), -8) = '$last8Sender' OR SUBSTRING(REPLACE(fax, '-', ''), -8) = '$last8Sender'";
    $contactResult = $conn->query($contactSql);

    if ($contactResult === FALSE) {
        die("Database query error: " . $conn->error);
    }

    $contactId = NULL;
    $contactName = NULL;
    $contact_field = "";

    if ($contactResult->num_rows > 0) {
        $contactRow = $contactResult->fetch_assoc();
        $contactId = $contactRow['contactid'];
        $contactName = $contactRow['firstname'] . ' ' . $contactRow['lastname'];
        echo "Found contact ID $contactId for sender $sender, last 8 digits: $last8Sender\n";

        // Create ticket title
        $ticket_title = "Received SMS from: $contactName ($sender)";
        $contact_field = "12x$contactId";
    } else {
        echo "No contact found for sender: $last8Sender\n";
        $ticket_title = "Received SMS from $sender";
    }

    // Ticket data for the webform
    $postData = array(
        "__vtrftk" => "sid:your-session-id,1234567890",
        "publicid" => "your-public-id",
        "urlencodeenable" => "1",
        "name" => "SMS to Ticket",
        "ticket_title" => $ticket_title,
        "ticketpriorities" => "Normal",
        "ticketstatus" => "SMS",
        "cf_sender" => $sender,
        "cf_receiver" => $receiver,
        "cf_received_at" => $received_at,
        "cf_message" => $message,
        "contact_id" => $contact_field
    );

    // Send data to the webform
    $ch = curl_init($vtiger_form_url);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, http_build_query($postData));
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);
    $response = curl_exec($ch);

    if ($response === FALSE) {
        echo "cURL error: " . curl_error($ch) . "\n";
    } else {
        echo "cURL response: " . $response . "\n";
    }

    curl_close($ch);
}

$conn->close();
?>
4. Deploying the Script
Upload the script:
Place the sms-receiver.php file in the root directory of your Vtiger CRM installation.
Set up the SMS provider:
Configure your SMS provider to send incoming messages to https://your-vtiger-domain.com/sms-receiver.php.
Test the integration:
Send a test SMS to verify that the incoming message is properly recorded as a trouble ticket in Vtiger.
